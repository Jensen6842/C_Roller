# C_Roller
My first project whilst on my Year In Industry. This program can take an expression in the form 'XdY + Z' etc.
and then parses it into a function that rolls the dice.
I made this to learn some basic C that I can apply later in my time at the company.
I learnt a lot of C functionality, primarily pointers, from this project as well as also learning about parsers and makefiles.
